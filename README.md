# Getting And Cleaning Data (Coursera course week 4 assignment)
Repository that contains the assignment for the week 4 of "Getting and Cleaning Data" on Coursera

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 
You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. In the repository you will find:
1)run_analysis.R, That download, uncompress and execute the required analysis
2)FinalTidyData.txt, a tidy data set as the result of the analysis execution
3)CodeBook.md, a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations
4)README.md, this file

The analysis implemented aims to deal with the following:

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
1.	Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3.	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.	Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
